In polynomial regression, higher-degree polynomial terms are added as predictors in the regression equation. Here's an explanation of polynomial regression and its use:\n",

However, higher-degree polynomials can lead to overfitting, where the model captures noise and idiosyncrasies in the data rather than the underlying true relationship. Overfitting can result in poor performance on new, unseen data.\n",
